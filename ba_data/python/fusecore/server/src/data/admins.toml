# Administrators are able to kick, mute and ban people, alongside having
# access to all commands and functionality that would be locked behind roles.
# YOU SHOULD ONLY ENLIST PEOPLE YOU FULLY TRUST!

# To append an administrator, append the line '[[admins]]', followed by the
# user's Account ID or Ballistica ID.
# Any additional admins require their own indent.

# [[admins]]
# account_id = "pb-AccountIDGoesHere=="
# [[admins]]
# ballistica_id = 'a-ballisticaID'

# How to get:
# - Account ID: Inside BombSquad, enter 'getaccountid' in settings->advanced->enter-code.
# - Ballistica ID: Click on your account in 'https://ballistica.net'
#                  or look for someone in 'https://ballistica.net/accounts'.
